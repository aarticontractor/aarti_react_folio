## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://aarticontractor.github.io/aarti_react_folio/)

Welcome to my portfolio! This portfolio project was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It serves as a central hub to present my work samples, skills, and experience to potential employers or clients. The portfolio follows a single-page application structure, with a header, navigation, content sections, and a footer.
